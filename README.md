# scfld-rs-library

## What is it?

This is a project template for RightScale UI libraries. It allows developers to quickly
scaffold a new library project with all the basic files properly setup.

In particular, this provides:

* Preconfigured for Angular 1.x and TypeScript
* Gulp tasks to precache templates and SVG images
* Demo application to test the library within the repo
* Testing using Karma

While this is preconfigured for RightScale's needs, a generated project or even this
template can easily be adapted to anyone.

## How to use this?

First you need to install Scfld and @rightscale/scfld-rs-library:

    npm i -g scfld @rightscale/scfld-rs-library

Then, create an empty folder and scaffold a project:

    scfld init rs-library

Answer a few questions and then you'll be good to go! The `README.md` file in your new
project will contain instructions.
